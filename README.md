# CrossMediaApp

This is a project based on example code released by The Android Open Source Project to manually demosaic an image captured as a bayer mosaic and roughly color balance
the image taken. This project calculates the colors in a RGB colorspace in real time, rather than using a color lookup table. This project was undertaken for the course
IMT4304 - Cross-media Color Reproduction at NTNU Gj√∏vik.
